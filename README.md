## Introduction

Steeltoe is an open source project aimed at developing cloud native .NET microservice applications.  This project provides libraries that follow similar development patterns from well-known and proven microservice libraries like Netflix OSS, Spring Cloud and others. 

Steeltoe libraries are built on top of .NET APIs, following the .NET Standard 2.0 specification. Therefore, Steeltoe allows you work with .NET Core and .NET Framework 4.x. 

Today, most Steeltoe components work in a stand-alone environment as well other PaaS implementations.

Steeltoe components typically build on other technology offerings, such as Netflix OSS and Spring Cloud by providing several packages that enable .NET developers to quickly leverage these tools when implementing some of the basic patterns (for example: centralized configuration management, service discovery, circuit breakers, etc.) typically found in highly scalable and resilient distributed applications.

Steeltoe provides services that broadly fall into two categories:

* Services that simplify using .NET and ASP.NET on cloud platforms like Cloud Foundry:
  * Connectors (MySql, PostgreSQL, Microsoft SQL Server, RabbitMQ, Redis, OAuth, etc)
  * Configuration
  * Security (OAuth SSO, JWT, Redis Key Ring Storage, etc.)
  * Logging

* Services that enable .NET and ASP.NET developers to leverage Netflix OSS, Spring Cloud and other industry leading services:
  * Configuration providers (Spring Cloud, Vault, etc.)
  * Service Discovery client (Netflix Eureka, etc.)
  * CircuitBreaker (Netflix Hystrix, etc.)
  * Management

[Steeltoe is freely available](https://www.nuget.org/packages?q=steeltoe) for production application usage today. Be sure to visit the [official Steeltoe site](https://steeltoe.io/).

## Project Repositories

Steeltoe is fully open source and is found under the SteeltoeOSS organization on GitHub. 

#### Steeltoe Core Components: 
These are located in the [Steeltoe](https://github.com/SteeltoeOSS/steeltoe) repository:

* Configuration - configuration providers which extend the reach of [.NET Configuration](https://github.com/aspnet/Configuration) services

* Common - Common packages to other Steeltoe components

* CircuitBreaker - monitor and isolate requests to remote dependent services with latency and fault tolerance logic

* Connectors - simplify the process of configuring and using back-end services locally and in the cloud

* Discovery - provide the ability to register and discover services locally and in the cloud

* Logging - adds logging extensions

* Management - add monitoring and management to production based application

* Security - simplify integration of security services provided by the cloud platform

#### Other Repositories:

* [Dockerfiles](https://github.com/SteeltoeOSS/Dockerfiles) - Our collection of docker files we have on dockerhub

* [eShopOnContainers](https://github.com/SteeltoeOSS/eShopOnContainers) - Sample reference microservice and container based application with added Steeltoe capabilities (Forked and updated from dotnet-architecture org)

## Roadmaps
* [3.0.0](roadmaps/3.0.0.md) - In Progress
* [2.3.0](roadmaps/2.3.0.md) - In Progress
* [2.2.0](roadmaps/2.2.0.md) - Released

## Getting Started

1. Perform any of the several [Quick Starts](https://steeltoe.io/docs/steeltoe-configuration/#1-1-quick-start) you will find throughout the [Steeltoe documentation](https://steeltoe.io/docs/).

1. Review, run, and modify the extensive collection of [Samples](https://github.com/SteeltoeOSS/Samples) available on Github.

1. To get down into the details of any Steeltoe project, read the [documentation](https://steeltoe.io/docs/).

## Getting the Code

The development of the core components of Steeltoe is done out of the [steeltoe](/) repository on the `master` branch.

Maintenance branches are created after each major release (i.e. 2.x) and minor branches (i.e. 2.2.x) are created as needed for regressions, and/or security issues.

All release and release candidate packages are listed under the tags section on GitHub (e.g. 2.2.0).

The latest Steeltoe packages from each branch can be found on [MyGet](https://www.myget.org/).

The released and release candidates can be found on [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/).
