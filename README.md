## Why Steeltoe?

Are you looking to create .NET microservices? Modernizing existing applications? Moving apps to containers? Steeltoe can help you!

[Steeltoe](https://steeltoe.io) is an open source project that provides a collection of libraries that helps users build production-grade cloud-native applications using externalized configuration, service discovery, distributed tracing, application management, and more.

We have also built several tools to get you started:

* [Steeltoe Initializr](https://start.steeltoe.io) - Pick and choose what type of application you would like to build and let us generate the initial project for you
  * Not only have we built Steeltoe Initializr site, but our templates are also available as an option from the `dotnet` CLI
  * We also have the ability to load these project templates inside of Visual Studio
* [Steeltoe Samples](https://github.com/SteeltoeOSS/Samples) - Here we have working samples for trying out features and to use as code references
