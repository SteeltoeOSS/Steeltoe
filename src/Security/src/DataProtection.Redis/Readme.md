# ASP.NET Core DataProtection Key Storage Provider for Redis

This project contains a [ASP.NET Core DataProtection Key Storage Provider](https://docs.asp.net/en/latest/security/data-protection/implementation/key-storage-providers.html) for Redis which works together with the Steeltoe Redis Connector for CloudFoundry.

This provider simplifies using Redis on CloudFoundry as a custom key repository.
