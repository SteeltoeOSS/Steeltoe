# .NET Logging Extensions

Logging extensions that, when used with Steeltoe Management, enable changing the Logging levels for a running application at run-time, without restarting the app.

Currently supporting the Microsoft Console Logger and Serilog.

For more information on how to use these components see the [Steeltoe documentation](https://steeltoe.io/).

See the `Management` directory of the [Samples](https://github.com/SteeltoeOSS/Samples) repository for examples of how to use these packages.
