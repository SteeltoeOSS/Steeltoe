             * are thread-safe by themselves but not the aggregate algorithm, thus we put this entire block of logic inside synchronized.
             * I am using a tryLock if/then (https://download.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/locks/Lock.html#tryLock())
             * so that a single thread will get the lock and as soon as one thread gets the lock all others will go the 'else' block
             * and just return the currentBucket until the newBucket is created. This should allow the throughput to be far higher
             * and only slow down 1 thread instead of blocking all of them in each cycle of creating a new bucket based on some testing
             * (and it makes sense that it should as well).
             * This means the timing won't be exact to the millisecond as to what data ends up in a bucket, but that's acceptable.
             * It's not critical to have exact precision to the millisecond, as long as it's rolling, if we can instead reduce the impact synchronization.
             * More importantly though it means that the 'if' block within the lock needs to be careful about what it changes that can still
             * be accessed concurrently in the 'else' block since we're not completely synchronizing access.
             * For example, we can't have a multi-step process to add a bucket, remove a bucket, then update the sum since the 'else' block of code
             * can retrieve the sum while this is all happening. The trade-off is that we don't maintain the rolling sum and let readers just iterate
             * bucket to calculate the sum themselves. This is an example of favoring write-performance instead of read-performance and how the tryLock
             * versus a synchronized block needs to be accommodated.
