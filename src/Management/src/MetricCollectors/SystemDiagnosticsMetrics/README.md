# SystemDiagnosticsMetrics

The code files in this directory were copied in their entirety from the release/7.0 branch of the .NET runtime repository on github:
https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/tree/release/7.0/src/libraries/System.Diagnostics.DiagnosticSource/src/System/Diagnostics/Metrics (at commit 4bc0fe951dc90c5af58631f23f194ab7985892d5).

This was done because Steeltoe needs access (and a few small changes) to internal types.

## Changes

There is a baseline commit that contains an exact copy of the code files. All changes in this repo will be separate commits on top of that.
