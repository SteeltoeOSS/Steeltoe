# SystemDiagnosticsMetrics

The code files in this directory were copied in their entirety from the release/7.0 branch of the .NET runtime repository on github:
https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/tree/release/7.0/src/libraries/System.Diagnostics.DiagnosticSource/src/System/Diagnostics/Metrics (at commit 4bc0fe951dc90c5af58631f23f194ab7985892d5).

This was done because Steeltoe needs access (and a few small changes) to internal types.

## Changes

There is a baseline commit that contains an exact copy of the code files. All changes in this repo will be separate commits on top of that.

All warnings are turned off using `#pragma warning disable` at the top of each file and the namespaces are adjusted to Steeltoe.
This directory is excluded from Resharper code analysis and formatting.

Aside from the above, any code changes from the baseline are wrapped in `Steeltoe-Start`/`Steeltoe-End` comment blocks.
