# Spring Cloud Config .NET Configuration Provider

This project contains the [Spring Cloud Config Server](https://projects.spring.io/spring-cloud/docs/1.0.3/spring-cloud.html#_spring_cloud_config) client configuration provider.  By acting as a client to the Spring Cloud Config Server, this provider enables the Config Server to become a source of configuration data for a .NET application.  You can learn more about Cloud Native Applications and the Spring Cloud Config Server at [Spring Cloud](https://projects.spring.io/spring-cloud/docs/1.0.3/spring-cloud.html).
