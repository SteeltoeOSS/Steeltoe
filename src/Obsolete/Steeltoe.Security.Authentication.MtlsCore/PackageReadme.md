[Steeltoe](https://steeltoe.io/) provides building blocks for development of .NET applications that integrate with [Spring](https://spring.io/) and [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot) environments, as well as [Cloud Foundry](https://www.cloudfoundry.org/) and [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) with first-party support for [Tanzu](https://tanzu.vmware.com/tanzu).

Key features include:

- Management endpoints (compatible with [actuators](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/actuator.html)), providing system info (such as versions, configuration, service container contents, mapped routes and HTTP traffic), heap/thread dumps, health checks, exporting metrics to [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/), and changing log levels at runtime.
- Connectivity to databases (such as [SQL Server](https://www.microsoft.com/sql-server)/[Azure SQL](https://azure.microsoft.com/products/azure-sql), [Cosmos DB](https://azure.microsoft.com/products/cosmos-db/), [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/), [Redis](https://redis.io/), [RabbitMQ](https://www.rabbitmq.com/), [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/), and [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/)), including support for [Entity Framework Core](https://learn.microsoft.com/ef/core/)
