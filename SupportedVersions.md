# Steeltoe Supported Versions 
This document shows all versions of Steeltoe and their support lifecycle.

## Support Policy
Steeltoe follows the [VMware Tanzu OSS support policy](https://tanzu.vmware.com/support/oss) for critical bugs and security issues.

* Major versions will be supported for at least 3 years from the release date (but you must run a supported minor version).

* Minor versions will be supported for at least 12 months.


## Released Versions
The supported .NET Runtimes have been tested against the latest patch release of each version.  We recommend running the latest minor with the latest patch release for each major version.

## Release Compatibility
The Steeltoe team is very aware of the need for stability and backward compatibility across our major releases (i.e. 2.x and 3.x). Our goal is to keep backward compatibility across all minor and maintenance releases (e.g. 3.1.3 would still work with 3.1.2, 3.1.1, 3.1.0).  For major releases, we reserve these releases to remove all deprecated code and make breaking changes when necessary for code optimization, enhancements, architecture changes, and redesign. We strive to keep all compatibility changes/breakages to major releases only .  There is a chance that we might be forced to break compatibility in a minor release, but it would be a rare occasion.
